# Changelog

All notable changes to Prism are documented in this file.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Transparent widget background**: New "Transparent" swatch (checkerboard icon) in Fill palette strips the Card background entirely, letting wallpaper show through
- **Widget text color**: New "Text" section in properties bar lets you override text/icon color per widget (Auto mode uses luminance detection or theme default)
- **Calendar transparent mode**: When calendar widget has custom/transparent background, day cell backgrounds are removed so wallpaper shows through the entire widget

### Fixed
- **Text color persistence**: Widget text color now saves to database (was being stripped by API validation)
- **Text color coverage**: Overrides CSS custom properties (`--foreground`, `--card-foreground`, `--muted-foreground`, `--primary`, `--seasonal-accent`) so all text, icons, and accents in the widget pick up the chosen color
- **Day view transparency**: DayViewSideBySide calendar now strips `bg-card/85` in transparent widget mode
- **Calendar dropdown**: Select trigger and filter chips go transparent with the widget
- **iPad properties bar**: Added `onPointerDown` + `touch-manipulation` to all swatch buttons for reliable iPad touch

### Added
- **Custom color picker**: Rainbow swatch in Fill, Outline, and Text sections opens native color picker for full color gamut

### Improved
- **Calendar dark mode**: Replaced hardcoded `bg-gray-200` past-day backgrounds with theme-aware `bg-muted` variants that adapt to light/dark mode
- **Properties bar UX**: Opacity buttons only appear when a color fill is selected (not for None or Transparent); Fill palette uses 9-column grid to accommodate Transparent swatch

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **Background opacity**: Widget background opacity no longer makes text/icons transparent — uses rgba background color instead of CSS opacity
- **Color picker touch targets**: Increased button sizes to meet 44px HIG minimum, prevented RGL drag from intercepting touch events on color picker
- **Pencil icon**: Edit icon in dashboard toolbar now opens rename dialog on click
- **Rename dialog**: Replaced browser `window.prompt()` with styled modal dialog (consistent with v1.0 polish)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- **Toast Notifications**: Replaced all 55 browser `alert()` calls with styled toast notifications (success/warning/destructive variants) using shadcn/Radix toast system
- **Confirm Dialogs**: Replaced all 18 browser `confirm()` calls with styled AlertDialog modals via reusable `useConfirmDialog` hook
- **Optimistic UI**: Task toggle, task delete, shopping item toggle, and shopping item delete now update instantly with automatic rollback on failure

### Added
- **Error Pages**: App-level `error.tsx` and `not-found.tsx` with route-level error boundaries for calendar and settings
- **Accessibility**: Added ~60 `aria-label` attributes to icon-only buttons across all views, widgets, modals, and settings sections
- **Stack trace protection**: Error boundaries gate error details behind `NODE_ENV === 'development'`
- **SSRF Protection**: Recipe URL import validates against private IP ranges, localhost, and internal hostnames
- **Rate Limiting**: Recipe URL import limited to 10 requests per 60 seconds per user
- **Docker Resource Limits**: Container memory and CPU caps (app: 2GB/2CPU, db: 2GB/2CPU, redis: 512MB/1CPU) with Redis LRU eviction policy

### Fixed
- **Console cleanup**: Removed 28 debug `console.log` calls from production code (birthday sync, calendar sync, calendar settings, backup utils)
- **TypeScript**: Replaced `as any` cast in maintenance route with proper type validation
- **Chore authorization**: Added missing `requireRole` check on POST /api/chores
- **Portrait grid overlap**: Bottom widgets no longer render behind the portrait navigation bar on iPads and vertical monitors

- **Screensaver Icon**: Monitor-with-play icon replaced with lamp/nightlight — better represents ambient display mode

### Improved
- **Auto-Slug Migration**: Existing layouts automatically receive URL slugs on first API fetch
