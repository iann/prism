/**
 * What /api/family discloses to a caller with no session.
 *
 * A wall display sits on a home network, and this endpoint answers before
 * anyone has authenticated — the login pad needs the member list to render.
 * So whatever it returns is readable by anything on the LAN.
 *
 * Names, faces and roles are already on the screen, so listing them changes
 * nothing. `hasPin` is different: it names which members are undefended, which
 * is exactly what someone would want to know before choosing who to target,
 * and it is not visible on the display. It belongs to the authenticated
 * response only.
