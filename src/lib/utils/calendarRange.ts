 *   - Postgres range scans over years are sub-millisecond (indexed on start
 *     time), and recurring events are stored as individual instance rows —
 *     there is no client-side recurrence expansion to blow up — so a wide
 *     window costs little.
 *   - A fixed window keeps navigation instant: paging months reuses one cached
 *     dataset instead of refetching (and flickering) on every prev/next.
 *   - It fixes the class of bug where events past a rolling horizon silently
 *     vanished from every view (#250).
